    <p>Dear Reader, <br>It's my pleasure to share the Graph Theory notes which I have written while pursuing an engineering degree. First and foremost, while writing these notes, I haven't thought that one day I will publish it digitally. Hence, you may find some spelling mistakes and semantic errors. After all, these are handwritten notes. Moreover, I know there are multiple resources available on the internet for the same. Nonetheless, I am hoping these quick notes will help you remember the concepts before going to an academic exams.
